# Solar-Tracker
Arduino based project on dual axis solar tracker

A dual axis solar tracker is a device that adjusts the position of solar panels to follow the sun’s movement 
in both horizontal and vertical directions. It helps to maximize the solar energy absorption and conversion 
into electricity. A dual axis solar tracker has two axes: a primary axis and a secondary axis. The primary 
axis rotates the solar panels from east to west, while the secondary axis tilts the solar panels from north to 
south. A dual axis solar tracker can generate up to 40% more power than a fixed solar panel system. It also 
has advantages such as flexibility, space efficiency, and grid stability. A dual axis solar tracker uses sensors, 
motors, controllers, and other components to track the sun’s position and angle throughout the day. It can 
also adjust to different weather conditions and seasons. A dual axis solar tracker is more complex and 
expensive than a single axis solar tracker, which only moves in one direction. However, it can also produce 
more energy and have a faster payback period.
